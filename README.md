# Climbing Grade Calculator
This is a tool I've been using myself during each of my climbing sessions. During a given session, I'll keep track of what climbs I attempt, and then use this program to tally up my total V-Points attempted. This combined with the length of the session gives me a good estimate of how hard I climbed.
